## Organization

* **Poet Name Folder:** Each poet has a folder named after them.

* **Poetic Work Folder:** Within the poet’s folder, there are subfolders for different poetic works.

* **Poem File:** Each poem is saved as a separate .txt file.

* **File Content:** Each line in the poem files represents a verse, with each hemistich separated by `|` character.


## Example

Let’s say you want to get a poem with the link `ganjoor.net/hafez/ghazal/sh354`. In this repository, this poem would be saved in a file located at the following path:
